[h3]Description[/h3]
Aevum waits in the [i]Stasis[/i] system and only the first visitor gets the event chain related to him. The first visitor will get quests from Aevum. 
Most of them will include a lengthy process and [i]a lot[/i] of patience. You see, Aevum has some control over the flow of time and his favorite activity is
to waste the time of others. Sounds fun? [i]No?[/i] What if I told you, Aevum will reward you with knowledge and [i]Zro[/i]?

[spoiler] Everything is locked to the one, who gets to survey his planet first. The 3 techs and the relic can be found without Aevum spawning [/spoiler] 

[h3]Wait, that's not the same Aevum from the MJ24?[/h3]
Yes, I spent some time [i]"refining"[/i] his concept and bring it more in line with Vanilla.

What's new?
> More flavour options. A lot actually. I have added ~30 new options to the event chain, many are locked behind ethics, civics or the mortality of your ruler.
> Refined textures and text. Some complained about the way he speaks even though it was intentional. Now he has a less cryptic way of speaking. Nontheless he will still sound like an enigma.
> [b]1[/b] new megastructure: [b]The Timeless Temple[/b] with custom model and a interesting effect. [spoiler] Like an [/b]Arc Furnace[/b] for Zro and a [/b]Zroni Stormcaster[/b] combined [/spoiler] 

What's gone?
> His powers you could cast via custom UI. It felt out of place. I wanted a leader you could add to Vanilla.
> His Resurrection mechanic

[h3]FAQ and notes from me[/h3]

[list]
    [*] DLC requirements? No, but you will miss out on some flavour options
    [*] Compatible with X? Yes! No overwrites were made, but some of his shenanigans can "disturb" other things. All of them can be influenced by you.
    [*] Found a bug? Tell me. I cant fix which Im not aware of.
    [*] I do not like X? Tell me. I like feedback.
    [*] Why are all your event IDs "mem_aevum", that's a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=727000451] More Events Mod [/url] thing? I have talked with Malthus and with his approval, this Aevum will be added to MEM
    [*] 
    [*] Many thanks to [b]Wandering Modder[/b] for the custom model, to [b]Malthus[/b] for generally helping me and proofreading and [b]Jin[/b] for constructive feedback
