 trime.1.desc:0 "Ah, era dwellers, in the presence of Aevum, the essence of time itself, you stand here again. What inquiries do cyclic beings harbor within the confines of their fleeting existence? Speak, and let the echoes of your short-lived desires reverberate through our discourse.\nI present you a quest, era dweller. Illuminate the heavens of my realm, §Y[trime_primitive_rewind_world.GetName]§!, reveal the extent of your capabilities. Let the radiance of your endeavors pierce the shadows that dance in the tapestry of my world!"
 trime.1.a:0 "Who are you?"
 trime.1.a.response:0 "I am §Y$NAME_trime_time_lord$§!, a god. Immortal, time's current eludes my grasp, as shadows dance in the veiled whispers of eternity."
 trime.1.b:0 "Why did you send §Y[trime_future_leader.GetName]§Y back in time?"
 trime.1.b.reponse:0 "Why should I not? We, era dwellers, have spoken in echoes of the past and glimpsed a future yet unborn. The current, a mere reflection, aligns with the symphony woven by fate. To question the convergence is to resist the cosmic embrace."
 trime.1.c:0 "Do you know anything about §Y[trime_primitive_rewind_world.System.GetName]§!?"

 trime.5.a:0 "What about a reward?"
 trime.5.a.response:0 "Ah, era-dweller, perceive, time meanders through labyrinthine passages. I neither deny nor yearn to deny your feeble request, but the moment for my action has not yet unraveled itself. "
 trime.5.b:0 "Why do you live among primitives?"
 trime.5.b.response:0 "The primitives, as you refer to them, may forge the shackles of your tomorrow's dominion. Or shall you ensnare them in the web of your mastery first?

Face the consequences. \n§Y*Sirens begin to echo on [Root.Capital.GetName] as his curse takes full effect.*§!"

Fear not, your reward looms near.\n§Y*He seemingly looks pleased. With a bright smile and expecting eyes he meets your tired expression*§!\nAnd now, as a final endeavor, a testament to my divine pleasure. Construct for me a temple, let it be the pinnacle of your architectural prowess. Honor me with the grandeur of your highest creation."
 trime.10.a:0 "§YAlright. Let's get building.§!"

 trime.11.name:0 "Last Meeting"
 trime.11.desc:0 "Yes well done. Take pride in your achievements. You inquire: What is our reward for such great patience and endeavor? It is simple, era dweller, indeed!

 trime.11.a:0 "What can you offer us?"
 trime.11.a.response:0 "Oh, young one, cease the queries of what I can offer your realm. Instead, ponder what offerings you shall present to a god. Your trials, a testament to worthiness, draw to a close. Embrace the culmination, bask in the power bestowed upon you. Why question that which transcends your young current?\n§Y*He pauses to think.*§!\nLet me reveal the tapestry of my capabilities. Have you ever contemplated the weaponization of time, the art of delaying foes, hastening economic flow, or expediting the construction of grand structures?"
 trime.11.b:0 "What happened to the creature, which destroyed Observation Station 37?"
 trime.11.b.response:0 "I have pondered the enigma of events lost in the currents of time, and it seems you have unearthed a fragment of the puzzle. Allow me to shed some light. The creature, known to the primitives as 'Vumi,' has chosen this system as its recurring tomb, returning to the brink of death every few years. I can affirm it is the same entity, caught in a cyclical dance of demise. Yet, a curious turn of fate unfolded some hundred years in the past, and the ritualistic dying ceased. Neither the primitives nor I hold the key to the mystery that unfolded in the shadows of that bygone era.\n§Y*He grins*§!\nOne might say, only time will tell."
 trime.11.c:0 "Why were you never evacuated?"
 trime.11.c.response:0 "You have touched upon a tender chord, era dweller. As painful as it is, I suspect my messages never found their way home. Lost in this system, Echoes endlessly reverberating back and forth, a lament sung by the timeless corridors. Nothing more than mockery, a cruel jest played by the cosmic forces upon the stage of my existence. The fate of me and my crew, now shrouded in the veils of your knowledge alone."
 trime.11.d:0 "You are no god, are you?"
 trime.11.d.response:0 "§Y*Long pause. Probably the longest he ever took.*§!\nWhat do you expect me to say? Yes and no, both veiled in untruths. I harbor no illusions for you to comprehend the boundaries of my power. Understand this: no god, in essence, is without Limits. Were you born a god, or did the flow of time grant you the title? Through millennia my power surpassed your era-bound understanding, and yet remains bounded. In the eyes of the primitives, you and I are divine, each possessing godlike abilities. It is not the absence of limitations that defines godhood, but the manifestation of what can be achieved. In this present epoch, I am a god, until the day when I am no longer."

 trime.16.name:0 "Captain's Log: Day 1276"
 trime.16.desc:0 "At last, I got this thing to work again. If only for one last message. Confirming: This will be my last recording. After our evacuation from the observation station, our escape pods passed several anomalies. One crew member de-aged into non-existence, another aged rapidly, succumbing to age within mere moments. Only three of us made it the surface. Most of our rations were spoiled. Our only option was to continue to the nearest primitive city and look for food and shelter. To hell with the prime directive. I could not let my crew die like this.\n§Y*A small sigh escapes him in the recording.*§!\n We managed to enter a city. Not as aliens were we met, but as messiahs. They believed us to be messengers of god. Somehow our appearances were already carved on several walls. In the following year, Shlay and Dirko died. Shlay had contracted a fatal infection. Dirko was mauled to death by a group of heretics after abusing his new role. What shameful deaths. I, however, remain. For what purpose? Who knows. \n§Y*A long pause.*§!\nTo whoever finds this message, tell our kin to expect us dead.\n- Aevum T. Dohrnii - Only survivor of Observation Station 37 "

Regarding the strange behaviour of the §Y[trime_primitive_rewind_world.System.GetName]§!: I am uncertain we will ever find what or who shattered time this way. I and the crew remain optimistic and hope, despite all odds, to uncover the roots of this mystery.\n- Aevum T. Dohrnii - Captain and leading scientist of Observation Station 37 "
