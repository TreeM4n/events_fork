As it end came it left a message for it`s finder:\n"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off shoulder of [owner.capital_star.GetName]. I watched particle-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.""

 mem_ceaseless.125.desc:0 "This wreckage of Probe 36Z, which is in perfect condition, is a baffling experience.

 mem_ceaseless.110.desc:0 "At first we got high hopes in this nearly intact remains of Probe 91K, but on closer inspection not much of value is left of it.\n\nIt`s database wiped clean, navigation logs erased and high value electronics removed.
