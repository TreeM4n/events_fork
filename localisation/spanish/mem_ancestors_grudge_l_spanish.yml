 START_SCREEN_MEM_ANCESTORS_GRUDGE:0 "Long, long ago, in ages past our kin lived in wealth and prosperity. Their rule spread all across [GetHomeWorldName] and even space, first among their colonies was our homeworld's moon, which became the industrial center of our ancestors' empire. There they bent metal to their will, continuing to hone their craft, and forged an empire of runes and durasteel.\n\nTheir greatest of achievements was the Relic-Forge, a mighty complex providing all the necessities to smith the finest of artifacts.\n\nBut wealth draws unwanted attention. And so it came to be that our ancestors were beset by many envious foes. Invaders, barbaric and uncivilized warmongers, started to rampage in our ancestors' territory. Unable do deter and confine this threat, a century-long devastating war broke out. During the final days countless of our ancestors laid down their lives in defense of the Relic-Forge... All in vain.\n\nTheir empire laid to ruin, billions perished in orbital bombardments, but not all was lost. After decades, survivors on [GetHomeWorldName] slowly began to reemerge from the vaults that saved them from the apocalypse.\n\nIt has now been nearly 500 cycles since the fall and we are finally ready to reclaim what is ours by right."

 START_SCREEN_MEM_ANCESTORS_GRUDGE_ROBOTS:0 "In the distant past our creators ruled the stars, their fleets patroled far away systems, protecting their wealth and prosperity. [GetHomeWorldName] was their homeworld and capital, but for them its moon was of even higher importance. It was their industrial center, where they bent metal to their will and honed their craft to smith artifacts of imcomparable quality. For this they had built a mighty complex to provide their smiths all required necessities - the Relic-Forge.\n\nBut their wealth made them a target for envious foes. Invaders, barbaric and uncivilized warmongers, started to rampage in our creators' territory. Unable do deter and confine this threat, a century-long devastating war broke out. It was during the final days of that conflict that we were activated. While the majority of their forces remained to protect the Relic-Forge in a futile last stand, we were sent from our factories to [GetHomeWorldName]. Here we were meant to protect civilians during their evacuation, but we failed. The planet's surface was set ablaze by orbital bombardment.\n\nWith only few of us remaining and our creators gone, it took many cycles for us to rebuild. Now the only thing left for us is vengeance."

Their company has ventured forth to chart the ruins surrounding our landing site and ascertain the task that lies before us. The location for our planetfall had not been chosen by chance, however, and so they quickly located our main objective - our ancestors' crowning jewel: the Relic-Forge. Half in ruins and buried by debris, yet despite all that it still stands.

This one in particular seems to be the central construction of its complex and also the most sizeable we have found so far.\n\nPreparations are being made to explore its interior.\n\nIn the meantime our scientists progress in reverse engineering the Relic-Forge by studying its construction. As far as they can tell, it is no coincidence, that it was located here on [mem_ancestors_grudge_planet.GetName] instead of our homeworld. Many of its processes do require the weak gravity of this world and simply would work on [Root.Owner.GetHomeWorldName]. With this new understanding we should now be able to further restore it."

 mem_ancestors_grudge.310.desc:0 "After what felt like years of wandering through those desecrated, unending corridors, the team had at last reached a great hall at the heart of the complex. The hall lay in utter ruin, its once-mighty stonework shattered, its grandeur brought low by a violent battle that had taken place there. The truth of what happened, was now plain to see. This hold was breached by our ancestors' archenemies the Vazurans, thrice cursed be their name. Apparently they had attempted an invasion, but our ancestors fought to the bitter end, forcing them to fall back and instead commit a devastating orbital bombardment.\n\nAt the center of the hall rests a single skeleton of our kin. Surrounding it lie the remains of dozens of Vazurans, their carapaces cracked and their heads smashed in by the force of unrelenting fury. This lone warrior must have fought to his final breath, his hammer claiming many lives before he fell.\n\nEven when all hope was lost, he fought on, defiant to the very end. May his deeds not be forgotten for he has earned a place in the songs of our kin."

Within the hall stands his famed runed anvil. His hammer lies beside him, a tool of his craft transformed to a weapon of violence in defense of his kin. By ancient tradition, such an act meant the smith swore an oath to never to forge again.\n\nIn death, Dranir held true to that oath, felling dozens of Vazurans before his own life was bygone. We shall fulfill his final rite as is fitting a hero. Dranir will be laid to rest alongside his hammer, never to forge nor fight again, his oath carried into eternity. The anvil will remain here, as a silent reminder of the past."
